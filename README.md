### Tasks:

1. Find online examples of detection COCO data-set (anything) with sky in the images.
2. Use Detectron2 by Facebook to run inference on the images or videos you find, with an existing Detectron2 model.
3. Create a script to manipulate the COCO data-set to the new COCO data-set when you take out thesky - doing it using another model to detect the skyline automatically.
